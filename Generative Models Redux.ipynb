    "- Provide your answers in the cell directly below each question.\n",
    "- Use **Markdown** for text-based answers (in **English**).\n",
    "- Use **code cells** for implementations.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Some questions are marked with a üß† (Critical Thinking) or a ‚≠ê (Bonus Exercise). These are for self-reflection and extra practice.\n",
    "- They are **optional** and do **not** award any points.\n",
    "- Answering them can help reinforce your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Rules\n",
    "- Only use the Python packages introduced in the assignment. Using unauthorized packages will result in **0 points** for the affected question.\n",
    "- Follow dataset instructions carefully.\n",
    "  - If no new dataset is mentioned, continue using the one from the previous task.\n",
    "  - Using a different dataset than instructed will result in **0 points** for that question.\n",
    "- All code must run correctly.\n",
    "  - If your code does not execute, you will receive a **50% deduction** for that question.\n",
    "  - Always test your code before submitting.\n",
    "- Incorrect or incomplete answers receive **0 points**.\n",
    "  - Partial credit may be awarded if the core idea is correct **and** the instructions are followed precisely.\n",
    "  - If you do not follow the instructions, you will receive **0 points**, regardless of effort or length.\n",
    "- Do not provide overly detailed or off-topic answers. Stay focused on what is asked. Extra information does not earn extra points.\n",
