    "### Important Rules\n",
    "- Only use the Python packages introduced in the assignment. Using unauthorized packages will result in **0 points** for the affected question.\n",
    "- Follow dataset instructions carefully.\n",
    "  - If no new dataset is mentioned, continue using the one from the previous task.\n",
    "  - Using a different dataset than instructed will result in **0 points** for that question.\n",
    "- All code must run correctly.\n",
    "  - If your code does not execute, you will receive a **50% deduction** for that question.\n",
    "  - Always test your code before submitting.\n",
    "- Incorrect or incomplete answers receive **0 points**.\n",
    "  - Partial credit may be awarded if the core idea is correct **and** the instructions are followed precisely.\n",
    "  - If you do not follow the instructions, you will receive **0 points**, regardless of effort or length.\n",
    "- Do not provide overly detailed or off-topic answers. Stay focused on what is asked. Extra information does not earn extra points.\n",

    "2. **Implement a Custom Elman RNN:**\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Compare with Built-in PyTorch Models:**\n",
    "    - You’ll then train and evaluate a PyTorch-based RNN using `nn.RNN`\n",
    "    - You will compare the text these models generate and discuss how the model architecture affects the quality of the output (e.g., coherence, structure, creativity)."
